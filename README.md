- âš¡ Fun fact: I love art. I established my first official business deal in 2012 with a mid-size company called Mobile Solutions. I spray painted two of the same logo, but different sizes on inside of the establishment. I drew the logo on a stencil and displayed it on the wall from my projector. I used a piece of cardboard to spray paint the letters in the font the client requested. It took about 20 cans of acrylic spray paint.. compliments of Binders Art Supplies.
