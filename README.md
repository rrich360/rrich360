- âš¡ Fun fact: I love software development, but I also love art. I established my first contract in 2012 for an LLC, Mobile Solutions. I spray painted two logos, which were located in the lobby and car garage of the car dealer shop. I drew the logo on a stencil and used my projector to spray paint the image from the stencil. I used a piece of cardboard and painter's tape to help form the letters then carved out the logo prior to spray painting them into the font/color the client requested. It took about 20 cans of acrylic spray paint.. compliments of Binders Art Supplies and two weeks to complete the job.
