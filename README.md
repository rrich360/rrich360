- âš¡ Fun fact: I love art. I established my first official business deal in 2012 for a LLC called Mobile Solutions. I completed a mid-sized and large-sized version of the same logo, which were located in the lobby and car garage of the car dealer shop. I drew the logo on a stencil and displayed it on the wall from my projector. I used a piece of cardboard and painter's tape to help form the letters then spray painted them into the font/color the client requested. It took about 20 cans of acrylic spray paint.. compliments of Binders Art Supplies.
