- âš¡ Fun fact: I love art. I established my first official business deal in 2012 with a mid-size company called Mobile Solutions. I painted two of the same logo inside the establishment. Materials used in this project consisted of stencils, a projector, cardboard for shaping, and 20 cans of acrylic spray paint compliments of Binders Art Supplies.
